	스티비 원더 -i just call to say i love you<br>
	No New Year's Day to celebrate<br>
	No chocolate covered candy<br>
	hearts to give away<br>
	No first of spring<br>
	No song to sing<br>
	In fact here's<br>
	just another ordinary day<br>
	No April rain No flower bloom<br>
	No wedding Saturday<br>
	within the month of June<br>
	But what it is<br>
	is something true<br>
	Made up of these three words<br>
	That I must say to you<br>
	I just called to say<br>
	I love you<br>
	I just called to say<br>
	how much I care<br>
	I just called to say<br>
	I love you<br>
	And I mean it<br>
	from the bottom of my heart<br>
	No summer's high No warm July<br>
	No harvest moon to light<br>
	one tender August night<br>
	No autumn breeze<br>
	No falling leaves<br>
	Not even time for birds<br>
	to fly to southem skies<br>
	No Libra sun No Halloween<br>
	No giving thanks to all the<br>
	Christmas joy you bring<br>
	But what it is<br>
	though old so new<br>
	to fill your heart no<br>
	three words could ever do<br>
	I just called to say</p>
